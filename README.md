# BWAI Hackathon Nov 2021
**Team Representative: Nitin Malik, Gurgaon, India

Team Members: Nayonika Chakraborty, Meghana Kota, Anand Mayangankar

**Problem Statement**: Not everyone is interested in 9-5 job. Those who have entrepreneurship mindset would like to start up their own companies and be their own boss. But majority of them are skeptical to take first step as they are not confident of their competencies and skills.

Existing Alternatives: Try to be an entrepreneur, if succeed it's good, otherwise do regular job

**Proposed Solution**: Using Machine Learning classifiers to predict the entrepreneurial competency in University students

Key metrics: Accuracy since classes are largely balanced

Target Customer: University students

Customer Pain: Not able to decide whether they should pursue entrepreneurship

Customer Gain: They will be able to take a call to pursue entrepreneurship or not if they opted for our solution

Unique value Proposition: One-stop solution. Just need to fill the details about their competencies

Revenue Model: Charging for the services and the detailed feedback offered to the customers
